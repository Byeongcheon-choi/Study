# Problem : The vertices of a binary tree with n vertices are numbered from 1 to n without duplicates. Given this binary tree's in-order and post-order, write a program to find the pre-order.

### input : In the first line, n(1≤n≤100,000) is given. In the next line, n natural numbers representing in-order are given, and in the next line, post-order is given in the same way.

### Output : Print the preorder on the first line.



##### EX)
##### input :				
##### 3
##### 1 2 3
##### 1 3 2


##### output:
##### 2 1 3
