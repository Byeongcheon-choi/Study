# Problem : Given a tree of N(2 ≤ N ≤ 40,000) vertices and receiving M(1 ≤ M ≤ 10,000) pairs of nodes, output the distance between the two nodes.

### input : The number of nodes N is input in the first line, and two points and distances connected on the tree are input in the next N-1 lines. M is given in the next line, and node pairs for which the distance is to be known are input in the next M lines, one pair per line. The distance between two points is a natural number less than or equal to 10,000.Vertices are numbered from 1 to N.
### Output : Outputs the distance between the two nodes, which are sequentially input in M ​​lines.
