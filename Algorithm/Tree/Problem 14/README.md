# Problem : A set S consisting of a total of N strings is given. Write a program to find out how many of the M strings given as input are contained in the set S.

### Input : The number of strings N and M (1 ≤ N ≤ 10,000, 1 ≤ M ≤ 10,000) are given on the first line. In the next N lines, the strings contained in the set S are given. ln the next M lines, strings to be checked are given. The string given as input consists only of lowercase alphabetic characters and does not exceed 500 in length. The same string is never given multiple times in set S.

### Output : The first line displays how many of the M strings are included in the set S.
