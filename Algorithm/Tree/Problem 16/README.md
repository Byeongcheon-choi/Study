## Input : In the first line, the number of test cases T is given. The number of nodes n is given in the first line of each test case. (1 ≤ n ≤ 1,000) All nodes of BT are numbered differently from 1 to n. The next line gives the result of traversing BT, and the next line gives the result of traversing the median. It is always given as input only if the result of two traversals creates a unique binary tree.

### Output : For each test case, it outputs the result of iteration.

##### ex) Input:
##### 2
##### 4
##### 3 2 1 4
##### 2 3 4 1
##### 8
##### 3 6 5 4 8 7 1 2
##### 5 6 8 4 3 1 2 7
##### output:
##### 2 4 1 3
##### 5 8 4 6 2 1 7 3
