# Problem : A tree without root is given. At this time, when the root of the tree is set to 1, write a program to find the parent of each node. 

### Input : In the first line, the number of nodes N (2 ≤ N ≤ 100,000) is given. From the second line, N-1 lines are given two vertices connected in the tree.

### Output : The parent node number of each node in N-1 lines from the first line is displayed in order, starting from node 2.
