# Problem : The diameter of the tree is the longest distance between any two points in the tree. Write a program to find the diameter of a tree.

### input : Tree is given as input. First, in the first line, the number of vertices V of the tree is given (2≤V≤100,000), and the information of the edge is given from the second line to V lines as follows.
First, a vertex number is given, followed by two integers indicating information on the connected edges, one for the vertex number and the other for the distance to the vertex.

### Output : Print the tree diameter on the first line.
