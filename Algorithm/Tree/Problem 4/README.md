## Given a tree, it will delete a node. At that time, write a program to find the number of leaf nodes in the remaining tree. Deleting a node removes the node and all of its descendants from the tree.
### Input : In the first line, the number of nodes in the tree, N, is given. N is a natural number less than or equal to 50. In the second line, the parent of each node is given from node 0 to node N-1. If there is no parent, (root) -1 is given. In the third line, the number of the node to be deleted is given.
### Output : When the node given as input is deleted from the tree given as input on the first line, the number of leaf nodes is output.
