## Full-time traveled to N countries for winter vacation and decided to find ego. However, since the full-time worker is afraid of new planes, she tries to travel between countries in as few planes as possible. Given the flight schedule for this vacation, let's help the full-time staff to travel to all countries on the least type of plane. When a full-time employee moves from one country to another, he or she travels through another country (even if it has already been visited).
### Input :The first line is given the number of test cases T (T ¡Â 100), The following information is given for each test case.
###        The first line is given the number of countries N (2 ¡Â N ¡Â 1 000) and the type of airplane M (1 ¡Â M ¡Â 10 000).
###        After that, a and b pairs are entered in M lines. It means that there are planes going back and forth between a and b. (1 ¡Â a, b ¡Â n; a ¡Á b)
###        The given flight schedule always forms a connection graph.
### Output : Print one line per test case.
###          Print out the minimum number of airplane types a full-time worker must take to travel to all countries.
