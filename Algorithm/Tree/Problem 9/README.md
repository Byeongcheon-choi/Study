## Problem : A tree of N (2 ¡Â N ¡Â 50,000) vertices is given. Each vertex of the tree is numbered from 1 to N, and the root is 1. Given M (1 ¡Â M ¡Â 10,000) pairs of two nodes, output the number of the closest common ancestors of the two nodes.
### Input :he number of nodes N is given in the first line, and two connected vertices in the tree are given in the next N-1 lines. The next line is given the number M of pairs for which the closest common ancestor is to be known, and the next M lines are given the vertex pairs.
### Output : Outputs the closest common ancestor of the two vertices, which were sequentially input in M lines.
